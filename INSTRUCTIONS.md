=========INSTRUCTIONS=========

Start by wiring the ESP8266 modules on the breadboard. Ensure that the MQ sensors are connected to the analog pins

Download the Arduino IDE software with this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/

Connect your laptop/PC to both ESP modules

Upload Main Module code to the ESP with DHT22 and MQ-2

Upload MQ-135 code to the ESP with MQ-135

To make permanent attachments solder female adapters for the pref board to plug in the ESP and the sensors and connect and power the sensors with wire specifically made for connections for soldering (Jumper wires can be used however)

Test again to make sure all conections are secure and you are seeing values on the LCD
